Generating convolutional and punctured convolutional codes and decoding them using Viterbi Algorithm

The pdf named report explains the process of generating a convolutional code and a punctured convolutional
code with a given puncturing matrix and decoding it using using Viterbi algorithm.

The code is divided into sections with each section dedicated to a specific task. 
No specific change has been made within convolutional or punctured convolutional code as per the question's demand.

The output is in the form of a graph plotted between bit error rate and bit flipping probability of a binary symmetric 
channel. The plot compares both the type of codes and presents convolutional code better than the punctured one. This 
is justified as convolutional code has more redundancy than the punctured convolutional code.
